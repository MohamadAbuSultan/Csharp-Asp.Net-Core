            the compilation process in C# involves the following steps:

            1- Lexical analysis: The source code is broken down into tokens.

            2- Syntax analysis: The tokens are analyzed to check for any syntax errors.

            3- Semantic analysis: The code is analyzed to check for any semantic errors.

            4- Code generation: The compiler generates an intermediate language code (IL or MSIL).

            5- Optimization: The IL code is optimized to improve performance.

            6- Execution: The IL code is executed by the .NET runtime
               which JIT compiles it into machine code specific to the platform it is running on
