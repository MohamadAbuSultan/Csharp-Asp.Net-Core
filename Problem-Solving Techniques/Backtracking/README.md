# Backtracking Problem-Solving Technique

Backtracking is an algorithmic method that incrementally tests possibilities and undoes them when they lead nowhere.

## When to Use
- Explore multiple possible solutions to the problem.
- A solution can be built incrementally, one decision at a time.
- Each choice affects subsequent choices, requiring a step-by-step approach.

## Applications of Backtracking Algorithm
- **Solving puzzles** (e.g., Sudoku).
- **Determining the shortest maze path**.
- **Addressing scheduling tasks**.
- **Allocating resources** efficiently.
