# Two Pointer Technique

## Overview
The Two Pointer Technique involves using two indices to traverse a data structure—typically arrays or strings—from different directions (e.g., start and end) to solve problems efficiently.

## Real-World Applications
- Finding a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.
- Removing duplicates from a sorted array.
- Reversing an array in-place.
- Partitioning arrays.
- Solving sliding window problems.
- Finding max area in the **Container With Most Water** problem.

## When to Use
- When you need to compare or manipulate elements at different positions.
- When you need to minimize/maximize something (distance, area, etc.).
- When linear traversal is preferable to brute-force approaches.

## When Not to Use
- When the problem requires backtracking or exhaustive search.
- When elements must be visited in a specific order that two pointers can't guarantee.

### Not all two-pointer problems involve sliding window techniques.
